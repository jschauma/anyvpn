NAME
     anyvpn -- connect to a Cisco AnyConnect VPN

SYNOPSIS
     anyvpn [-Vhv] [-m method] [-p app] [-s site] on|off|sites

DESCRIPTION
     anyvpn is a simple script that allows you to connect to a Cisco AnyCon-
     nect VPN via the commandline by supplying your password and 2FA method so
     as to minimize interactions with the process.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported by anyvpn:

     -V		Print the current version information and exit.

     -h		Display help and exit.

     -m method	Use this 2FA method.  Valid options are 'push' or a Duo 2FA
		code.  Defaults to 'push'.

     -p app	Use this password manager app.	Currently supported: lastpass,
		onepass.  If not specified, anyvpn will use 'lastpass'.

     -s site	Connect to this site.  Defaults to the value of the VPN_SITE
		environment variable or, if that is unset, the first site
		condigured in AnyConnect.

     -v		Be verbose.  Can be specified multiple times.

     Any other arguments are passed through to the AnyConnect VPN command.

DETAILS
     In order to connect to a VPN via Cisco AnyConnect, you may need to pro-
     vide your password as well as a second factor.  Retrieving your password
     from a password manager can be cumbersome, since AnyConnect does not
     integrate with e.g., LastPass, leading to many people choosing to use an
     easy to remember VPN password.

     anyvpn provides the necessary glue to make it easier to connect to the
     VPN without having to unlock your password manager and copy and paste
     your password.

EXIT STATUS
     The anyvpn utility will exit with a value of 255 if it encounters any
     problems prior to executing the AnyConnect 'vpn' command.	Otherwise,
     anyvpn will return with the exit value of the AnyConnect 'vpn' command.

EXAMPLES
     The following examples illustrate common usage of the anyvpn utility.

     To connect to the VPN using the password stored under the "Yahoo" login
     entry in your LastPass password manager for the "jschauma@yahoo.com"
     account:

	   export LASTPASS_LOGIN="jschauma@yahoo.com"
	   export PM_VPN_ENTRY="Yahoo"
	   anyvpn on

     To connect to the VPN using the password stored under the "Yahoo" login
     entry in your 1Password password manager for the "jschauma@yahoo.com"
     account in your company's team vault "mycorp.1password.com":

	   export USER="jschauma"
	   export DOMAIN="yahoo.com"
	   export PM_VPN_ENTRY="Yahoo"
	   export ONEPASS_ADDRESS="mycorp.1password.com"
	   anyvpn -p onepass on

     To connect to the "NYC" VPN site using an existing 1Password session from
     your personal 1Password account:

	   export ONEPASS_SESSION="$(op signin --raw)"
	   export PM_VPN_ENTRY="Yahoo"
	   anyvpn -s NYC -p onepass on

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of this tool:

     ANYCONNECT_PREFIX	  The path to where AnyConnect is installed.  Defaults
			  to "/opt/cisco/anyconnect".

     DOMAIN		  The domain to use when constructing your LAST-
			  PASS_LOGIN or ONEPASS_LOGIN ID.

			  If unset, anyvpn will try to identify a suitable
			  domain by looking at /etc/resolv.conf or the output
			  of the hostname(1) command.

     LASTPASS_LOGIN	  The full LastPass user ID.  This may be e.g.,
			  "first.lass@company.tld", "${USER}@company.name"
			  etc.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will use "${USER}@${DOMAIN}".

     LASTPASS_VPN_ENTRY	  The name of the LastPass entry for your VPN login.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will use the value of the
			  PM_VPN_ENTRY environment variable.

     ONEPASS_ADDRESS	  The 1Password "sign in address".  If not specified,
			  defaults to "my.1password.com".  See
			  https://is.gd/BR670l for details.

     ONEPASS_LOGIN	  The 1Password user ID.  This may be e.g.,
			  "first.lass@company.tld", "${USER}@company.name}
			  etc.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will use "${USER}@${DOMAIN}".

     ONEPASS_SESSION	  The 1Password op(1) session token to use.  Setting
			  this in your environment allows you to sign in to
			  your 1Password account in your shell, and anyvpn to
			  retrieve the password without requiring your master
			  password to be entered.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will sign in to your 1Password
			  account, prompting you for your master password,
			  retrieve the VPN password, and then invalidate the
			  session.

     ONEPASS_VPN_ENTRY	  The name of the 1Password entry for your VPN login.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will use the value of the
			  PM_VPN_ENTRY environment variable.

     PM_VPN_ENTRY	  The name of the password manager entry for your VPN
			  login.  If unset, then anyvpn will use "VPN".

     USER		  The local username, as commonly set on most unix
			  systems.  This variable is not used directly, but
			  some of the other variables described here may
			  derive their default value from this variable.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will use the output of 'id
			  -un'.

     VPN_SITE		  The name of the VPN site to connect to.  Supported
			  values can be shown by specifying sites as the argu-
			  ment to anyvpn.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will use the first site con-
			  figured in AnyConnect.

     VPN_USER		  The short name / user ID, commonly your VPN or SSO
			  login name.

			  If unset, then anyvpn will use "${USER}".
