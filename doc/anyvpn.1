Cisco AnyConnect VPN via the commandline by supplying

.El
.Pp
Any other arguments are passed through to the
AnyConnect VPN command.
.Sh DETAILS
In order to connect to a VPN via Cisco
AnyConnect, you may need to provide your password as
well as a second factor.
Retrieving your password from a password manager can
be cumbersome, since AnyConnect does not integrate
with e.g., LastPass, leading to many people
choosing to use an easy to remember VPN password.
.Pp
.Nm
provides the necessary glue to make it easier to
connect to the VPN without having to unlock your
password manager and copy and paste your password.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will exit with a value of 255 if it encounters
any problems prior to executing the AnyConnect 'vpn'
command.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will return with the exit value of the AnyConnect
\'vpn' command.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples illustrate common usage of the
.Nm
utility.
.Pp
To connect to the VPN using the password stored under
the "Yahoo" login entry in your LastPass password
manager for the "jschauma@yahoo.com" account:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
export LASTPASS_LOGIN="jschauma@yahoo.com"
export PM_VPN_ENTRY="Yahoo"
anyvpn on
.Ed
.Pp
To connect to the VPN using the password stored under
the "Yahoo" login entry in your 1Password password
manager for the "jschauma@yahoo.com" account in your
company's team vault "mycorp.1password.com":
.Bd -literal -offset indent
export USER="jschauma"
export DOMAIN="yahoo.com"
export PM_VPN_ENTRY="Yahoo"
export ONEPASS_ADDRESS="mycorp.1password.com"

will try to identify a suitable domain by looking at
/etc/resolv.conf or the output of the
.Xr hostname 1
command.
.It Ev LASTPASS_LOGIN
The full LastPass user ID.
This may be e.g., "first.lass@company.tld",
"${USER}@company.name" etc.
.Pp
If unset, then
.Nm
will use
"${USER}@${DOMAIN}".
.It Ev LASTPASS_VPN_ENTRY
