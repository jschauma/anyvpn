.Nm
.Op Fl Vhv
.Op Fl m Ar method
.Op Fl s Ar site
.Ar on|off|sites
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple script that allows you to connect to a
Cisco AnyConnect VPN via the commandline by supplying
your password and 2FA method so as to minimize
interactions with the process.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width m_method_
.It Fl V
Print the current version information and exit.
.It Fl h
Display help and exit.
.It Fl m Ar method
Use this 2FA method.
Valid options are 'push' or a Duo 2FA code.
Defaults to 'push'.
.It Fl s Ar site
Connect to this site.
Defaults to the value of the VPN_SITE environment
variable or, if that is unset, the first site
configured in AnyConnect.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
Can be specified multiple times.
.El
.Pp
Any other arguments are passed through to the
AnyConnect VPN command.
.Sh DETAILS
In order to connect to a VPN via Cisco
AnyConnect, you may need to provide your password as
well as a second factor.
Retrieving your password from a password manager can
be cumbersome, since AnyConnect does not integrate
with e.g., LastPass, leading to many people
choosing to use an easy to remember VPN password.
.Pp
.Nm
provides the necessary glue to make it easier to
connect to the VPN without having to unlock your
password manager and copy and paste your password.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will exit with a value of 255 if it encounters
any problems prior to executing the AnyConnect 'vpn'
command.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will return with the exit value of the AnyConnect
\'vpn' command.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of this tool:
.Bl -tag -width LASTPASS_VPN_ENTRY_
.It Ev ANYCONNECT_PREFIX
The path to where AnyConnect is installed.
Defaults to "/opt/cisco/anyconnect".
.It Ev DOMAIN
If LASTPASS_LOGIN is unset, then
.Nm
will attempt to construct a reasonable login address
for LastPass, using this domain.
If unset,
.Nm
will try to identify a suitable domain by looking at
/etc/resolv.conf or the output of the
.Xr hostname 1
command.
.It Ev LASTPASS_LOGIN
The full LastPass user ID.
This may be e.g., "first.lass@company.tld",
"${USER}@company.name" etc.
.Pp
If unset, then
.Nm
will use
"${USER}@${DOMAIN}".
.It Ev LASTPASS_VPN_ENTRY
The name of the LastPass entry for your VPN login.
.Pp
If unset, then
.Nm
will use "VPN".
.It Ev USER
The local username, as commonly set on most unix
systems.
This variable is not used directly, but some of the
other variables described here may derive their
default value from this variable.
.Pp
If unset, then
.Nm
will use the output of 'id -un'.
.It Ev VPN_SITE
The name of the VPN site to connect to.
Supported values can be shown by specifying
.Ar sites
as the argument to
.Nm .
.Pp
If unset, then
.Nm
will use the first site configured in AnyConnect.
.It Ev VPN_USER
The short name / user ID, commonly your VPN or SSO
